# The SnakeTeX Templating System

Using the SnakeTeX templating system will be very familiar for users who already came across the Jinja templating system (flask users for instance). All of the possibilities Jinja provides are also possible in SnakeTeX templates because it uses Jinja as backend. However, the escaping is a little different because LaTeX has other needs than regular HTML/XML documents which are usually manipulated with Jinja.
